KEY FEATURES
1. E-Farmer ID (EFN) – Unified Digital Farmer Identity

A unique, secure digital ID linked with Aadhaar (conceptually), family ration card, and verified land records to eliminate ghost farmers.

2. Verified Land & Ownership Profile

Includes GPS coordinates, land area, FMB sketch details, and tehsildar-certified records to prevent fake or inflated land claims.

3. Entitlement-Based Subsidy Limits

Automatic calculation of allowed fertilizer/seed quantity based on land size, crop type, soil characteristics, rainfall zone, and region.

4. Dealer Transaction Logging

Every subsidy issue (fertilizer/seed) is digitally recorded against the farmer’s EFN, enabling complete traceability and preventing black-market diversion.

5. Real-Time Fraud & Anomaly Detection

Rule-based detection highlights suspicious patterns such as oversized claims, duplicate usage, abnormal dealer behavior, and clustered ghost entries.

6. AI-Based Land Verification (Prototype)

Farmers upload land photos with GPS metadata; neighbour cross-validation and AI checks help confirm crop type, soil consistency, and real farming activity.

7. Officer Dashboard & Alerts

A centralized dashboard shows total farmers, subsidy issued, suspicious alerts, risk scores, and dealer anomalies for fast decision-making.
